/** Comparison pages (P1-5) — pure data, no components, so vitest can pin the
 * invariants that keep these pages honest without a JSX pipeline.
 *
 * The spec's constraint is the whole design brief: "Factual and neutral in
 * tone — differences, not disparagement." Four rules follow, all enforced by
 * `compare.test.ts`:
 *
 *  1. EVERY page uses the SAME axes in the SAME order. A table whose rows
 *     change per competitor is how comparison pages become dishonest — you
 *     quietly drop the row you lose. We lose "Markets & data" to all six.
 *     It stays.
 *  2. EVERY page lists what the OTHER product does better
 *     (`theirAdvantages`, required non-empty). Most of these tools do things
 *     we deliberately don't: live trading, broker execution, real-time
 *     scanning, institutional data. A page where we win every row is
 *     marketing, and readers can smell it.
 *  3. Every claim about a competitor carries the URL it was read from and the
 *     date it was checked, and every one of those URLs was fetched and
 *     confirmed 2xx before shipping. A dead citation on a site whose pitch is
 *     "we sell the proof" is worse than no citation.
 *  4. Where a vendor's own pages are ambiguous, we quote them rather than
 *     resolving the ambiguity in our favour — hence "X to Y per month
 *     depending on billing term" for TrendSpider, whose site does not publish
 *     which end maps to which term.
 *
 * Sourced by a 13-agent research + adversarial fact-check pass on 2026-08-06.
 * The fact-check overturned 8 claims the research pass had accepted. When
 * refreshing, re-run the same discipline: read the vendor's own page, quote
 * it, and treat absence of documentation as absence of evidence — never as
 * evidence of absence.
